Welcome to Lighthouse!

Introduction
------------
Lighthouse is a rich collaboration portal centered on emerging design. The highly collaborative nature of software development is known to lead to a number of problems, including conflicting work, design erosion, and difficulties in understanding overall progress. The underlying cause is a lack of insight into the parallel programming activities of developers and how the code changes that result interfere, alter the design, and contribute to the overall system. Lighthouse monitors all ongoing changes in all workspaces to provide developers with a visualization of the emerging design â€“ the design as it exists in the code as virtually integrated across all workspaces. Using the emerging design, developers can gauge whether they may need to coordinate their changes with those of other developers, whether the quality of the overall design remains in tact or must be addressed, and whether overall progress is on track or must be reconsidered.
